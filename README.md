# Leonardo

A Graphite Dashboard, massively inspired by the excellent [ripienaar](https://github.com/ripienaar)'s [GDash](https://github.com/ripienaar/gdash)

It was rewritten in Python.

Differences with Gdash :
- Configuration is in full YAML instead of a DSL.
- Ability to display multiple dashboards on a single page for comparison
- Zoom in/out
